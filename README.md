## **Overview**

The implementation does not explicitly include `train()` and `test()` methods. Instead, the following commands are used for training:

- **Train REINFORCE model:**
  ```bash
  python homework3.py
  ```
- **Train Actor Critic Model:**
  ```bash
  python hw3_actor_critic.py
  ```

---

## **Results**

REINFORCE model was trained for 5000 episodes with 50 steps per episode. However, the training results only show a very minor improvement through the training.
